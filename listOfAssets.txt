--All the third-party assets I used in my project--

--Note: I tried to add some VR platform support, and I also added "Meta XR All-in-One SDK" from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-all-in-one-sdk-269657. However, I don't have a VR set nor controllers, so I couldn't test it. That's why I ended up using the FirstPerson asset and made my game keyboard-and-mouse-based input game.
